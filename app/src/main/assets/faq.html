<p><b>1. Why do you need my biological information?</b></p>
<p class="answer_text">Foodingo uses your information to calculate the average calories that you require on a daily
basis. The calculation is based on widely used nutritional equations and our correction
algorithm which allows for calories addition and reduction in the meals based on individual
user requirements.
All of this data is kept confidential; your personal data is secure and only for the use of the
algorithm.</p>
<p><b>2. How do I update my meals and snacks if my eating habit has changed?</b></p>
 <p class="answer_text">Since your meal and snack frequency is used to distribute your calorie intake throughout the
day, you can only update your meals and snack frequency at the start of each day; before
you have consumed anything.</p>
<p><b>3. I usually take a drink along with my meal, how do I factor that in?</b></p>
<p class="answer_text">You can separately add that as a snack item through food cart. The additional intake of a
sweetened drink will leave less calories for the next meal. Foodingo will automatically
reduce your calorie intake for the next meal.</p>
<p><b>4. How accurate is your nutrition information?</b></p>
<p class="answer_text">We aggregate information from verified nutrition tables of ingredients and match that to
the dishes available. Our partner nutritionists help us in aggregating and checking through
the data. The nutritional values are then standardized for each dish category. At this point,
the calorie information is an estimate for the dishes based on the data collected. We shall,
however, continue to make the data more and more accurate.</p>
<p><b>5. Will I be able to lose weight if I follow your recommendations?</b></p>
<p class="answer_text">Yes. Our correction algorithm calibrates your calorie intake based on your BMI. This means
that we recommend low calorie meals if you are heavier. Cutting down on calories while
keeping the activity level constant usually results in weight loss.</p>
<p><b>6. How do you categorize Halal dishes?</b></p>
<p class="answer_text">We follow the certification by MUIS and only consider Halal the dishes in restaurants with
an active Halal certificate. This, however, also means that some of the purely vegetarian
restaurants may not show up in the Halal-only category.</p>
<p><b>7. How do you define Vegetarian dishes?</b></p>
<p class="answer_text">Dishes which do not use any meat or derivatives of meat in cooking. This category is strictly
different from Vegan preference since a vegetarian dish may still have eggs or dairy
products.</p>
